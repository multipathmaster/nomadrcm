# nomadrcm (Nomad Rocket.Chat Monitoring Service)
A container/service for sending alerts to Rocket.Chat for common Nomad job problems/issues.<br>

#QUICK OVERVIEW:<br>
docker-entrypoint.sh is the entrypoint. It calls upon dead_man_switch.sh.<br>
dead_man_switch.sh starts the nmd_evnt_mntr.sh instances, as well a providing other options.<br>
nmd_evnt_mntr.sh is a collection of event monitors that call upon rocketc_alert.sh once a condition is met.<br>
rocketc_alert.sh is the alerting mechanism.<br>

#BREAK UP INSTANCES OR SINGLE CONTAINER QUESTION?:
1.  comment out all the monitors but one in dead_man_switch.sh
2.  build the image and name it appropriately for that specific check.
3.  build another one with a different one uncommented, name it appropriately, so on and so forth.
4.  alternatively just run the bash scripts on a live host? but defeating fault tolerance of a task scheduler.<br>

#HA PLAN?:
1.  if you plan on running this on your hashicorp stack (consul/nomad), it would be wise to already have multiple datacenters setup, run this on one DC that is separate from the other, otherwise the "Running" check will not work if the very container/service that is monitoring the DC is also offline as well.  so if you have 2 DCs, run 2 of these instances, but point them to the nomad IPs/HOSTNAMES of the opposite DCs.  if you have 3 DCs, you will need at least 4 instances, and after that, you should probably dedicate a DC solely for monitoring the rest of the configured REGION/REGIONS.<br>

STEPS FOR SOLO DEPLOYMENT:
1.  edit the variables within the scripts for your environment.
2.  test that it works by running dead_man_switch.sh loud/silent/talk/kill as well as rocketc_alert.sh queued/running/failed/lost
3.  `docker build .`
4.  `docker tag "ID FROM ABOVE" "NEW NAME"`
5.  `docker run -it -e NOMAD_JOB_PHN='http://NOMAD_SERVER_IP:4646/v1/jobs' \`
     `-e NOMAD_SRV_JOB_PATH='http://NOMAD_SERVER_IP:3000/nomad/REGION/jobs' \`
     `-e RC_SRV_PRT='http://Rocket.Chat.SERVER:3000' \`
     `-e RC_AUTH='username=BOTNAME&password=BOTPASSWD' \`
     `"NEW IMAGE NAME" `
6.  `docker ps #FIND CONTAINER`
7.  `docker exec -it "CONTAINER" bash`

STEPS FOR DEPLOYING ON THE HASHICORP STACK: (CONSUL/NOMAD):
1.  edit the variables within the scripts for your environment.
2.  test that it works by running dead_man_switch.sh loud/silent/talk/kill as well as rocketc_alert.sh queued/running/failed/lost
3.  `docker build .`
4.  `docker tag "ID FROM ABOVE" "NEW NAME"`
5.  export the image however you wish and place it in a repo.  i use a local repo w/ a simple registry container on
port 5000.  i.e. you can use artifactory or something similar instead.
6.  copy the below config into nomadrcm.nomad (or whatever_name_you_wish.nomad/json/etc...)
```
job "nomadrcm" {
  region = "YOUR_REGION"
  datacenters = ["YOUR_DC"]
  type = "service"
   constraint {
     attribute = "${attr.kernel.name}"
     value     = "linux"
   }
  update {
    stagger = "15s"
    max_parallel = 1
  }
  group "nomadrcm" {
    count = 1
    constraint {
      operator = "distinct_hosts"
      value    = "true"
    }
    restart {
      attempts = 10
      interval = "5m"
      delay = "25s"
      mode = "delay"
    }
    ephemeral_disk {
      size = 128
    }
    task "nomadrcm" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        #image = "localhost:5000/nomad_rc_monitor"
        network_mode = "host"
        port_map = {
        }
        #volumes = [ "" ]
      }
      env {
        NOMAD_JOB_IPHN="http://NOMAD_SERVER_IP:4646/v1/jobs"
        NOMAD_SRV_JOB_PATH="http://NOMAD_SERVER_IP:3000/nomad/HOUSE/jobs"
        RC_SRV_PRT="http://Rocket.Chat.SERVER:3000"
        RC_AUTH="username=BOTNAME&password=BOTPASSWD"
      }
      resources {
        cpu    = 32
        memory = 128
        network {
          mbits = 10
        }
      }
      service {
        name = "nomadrcm"
        tags = ["nomadrcm"]
        #port = "nomadrcm"
        #check {
        #  name     = "alive"
        #  type     = "tcp"
        #  interval = "15s"
        #  timeout  = "3s"
        #}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
7.  `nomad plan nomadrcm.nomad`
8.  make any adjustments to the plan as you see fit(i.e. task/group/resources/service changes).
9.  `nomad run nomadrcm.nomad` <br>
